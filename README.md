## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS

Basic HTML and CSS used to create a static website. Media queries and relative lengths were used to make the website responsive. Psuedo-classes such as ":hover" used for better styling effects on buttons / links.

## Lessons Learned:

Psuedo-classes are extremely useful for adding some "flavour" to a website. It not only makes a website more interesting but it also improves the ux. Having a cue for when you are over a link or a button makes it easier to distinguish it's functionality.
